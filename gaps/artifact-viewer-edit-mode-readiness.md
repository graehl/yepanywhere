# Artifact viewer Edit source dialog intermittently fails to appear

[CI run 36887819900](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36887819900)
on `b8346ebab` reported the artifact viewer icon-mode case as flaky. At
`packages/client/e2e/artifact-viewer.spec.ts:244`, the exact `Edit source`
dialog never appeared within the existing 5-second assertion; its retry
passed. The shard's uploaded browser evidence includes both first-attempt
screenshots and the error context for
`artifact-viewer-viewer-ico-87485-ugh-Shift-and-middle-clicks`.

Found beside the native mobile CI repair. That repair does not touch artifact
viewer editing, and this wait is not the native typing requirement. Diagnose
the mode transition from the uploaded evidence before choosing a change;
no assertion or retry policy has been weakened to hide it.

Found 2026-10-01 while repairing simulator and native WebView CI.

## Broad local failure 2026-10-10

The full browser run at `debb025bb` also failed the icon-mode case, plus four
other cases in `packages/client/e2e/artifact-viewer.spec.ts`: frame-local Find,
framed PDF handoff, saving a frame-generated file, and authenticated Edit links.
Their expected dialog, frame or controls were absent. This broader symptom
must not be attributed to the earlier CI mode transition without diagnosis.

The Find case's error context shows a fatal
`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')` in `BrowserRouter`, with
Vite-optimized React/router dependency paths. A duplicate React runtime is a
hypothesis, not a confirmed cause. Reproduce the component fixture and inspect
dependency identity before changing viewer behavior or increasing timeouts.

Evidence is under
`packages/client/test-results/9ebe4732-5fad-49db-945a-f9ab17b547b5/`, notably
`artifact-viewer-finds-with-73ba7-me-only-from-its-own-Ctrl-F/error-context.md`.
Full local output is retained in
`/local/graehl/ya-boot/final-deep-browser.{out,err}`.
The startup bundle does not run on this viewer route, but the run does not
establish whether these failures predate the startup series. No assertions
were relaxed. Contributing-model: 6-astra.
